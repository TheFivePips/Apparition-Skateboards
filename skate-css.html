           <p class="sm-font-review">"I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Honestly; I'm convinced this is the most legit spot to realize your skating dreams... haha but seriously!!! This will be my skate shop for life... Despite industry issues with availability (across the board online and witnessed personally in the 4 or 5 other shops i stopped in between two cities); I was able to get a super unique, top notch, inspiring setup that fits my needs... and it was put together with professionalism and insight. Good times! ... I love the board 10 x's more after taking it out for a couple hours after i left... booom booom!"</p>

            <p class="sm-font-review">"Brought my son here to fulfill his 13th birthday dream gift! Customer service was amazing! Troy went above and beyond talking with my son and assisting him in choosing everything he needed for the type of skating my son enjoys. The  store has a great selection of quality boards and my son easily found the brand he was seeking. We have been back since then and won't go anywhere else for any of my son's skating wants/needs!"</p>

           <p class="sm-font-review">"So glad I ended up here! Friendly, knowledgeable, and down-to-earth. Just like the shops of my youth! I started skating again after a nearly decade hiatus: I'm old now, with bad knees and definitely can't do what I used to but still really missed rolling around. Troy was super cool and reassuring and helped make me a setup that would work for my needs and now I'm back to cruising the neighborhood. Even the customers were nice and showed me their own personal boards and let me try them out so see if I would like components of theirs. Thanks for not making me feel like an idiot!"</p>

            <p class="sm-font-review">"My fiancee and I stopped in to build two boards and Michelle couldn't have been more helpful. Pricing was consistent with online shops, they have good selection, and played some great tunes! Awesome local shop!!"</p>
